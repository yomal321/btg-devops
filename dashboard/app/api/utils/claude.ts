export const SEVERITY_RUBRIC = `Severity rubric — apply strictly, do not default to Critical for anything security-related:
- Critical: actively exploitable right now, data exposed to the internet, or bleeding significant money today (e.g. public blob access on an account holding real data; credentials sitting in plain app settings).
- Warning: a real risk or real waste, but it needs another factor to become an incident (e.g. key rotation not enabled, missing backup, RU/s provisioned far above actual usage).
- Info: a deviation from best practice with no current impact.
Tie-break rule: if you are unsure between two severities, pick the lower one. A finding is not Critical just because it is security-related.

Evidence requirement: "issue" is the plain-English problem statement; "evidence" must separately cite the exact field/value from the data that proves it (e.g. "publicNetworkAccess = \"Enabled\", ipRules = [] (empty)"). If you cannot point to a specific field/value proving the issue, do not report it — do not guess or report something generic.`
